# TakeHomeProject

Identifeye Health Take Home Project - Aarush Agrawal

- In order to view the code + tests, change your working directory to /Main/tests and view file main.py
- I decided to have the implementation and tests in the same file because it reduces complexity regarding file imports(for some reason I was having trouble importing files and spent a significant amount of time on that (1.5 hours+) so I decided to just have everything in one file)
- I decided to test the method by using an array with the expected data stored inside of it, so on the tests I just check if the arrays match
- Data for tests is stored in the Data folder in Main/tests
