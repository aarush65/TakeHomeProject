Identifeye Health Take Home Project - Aarush Agrawal

- In order to view the code + tests, change your working directory to /Main/tests and view file test_main.py
- I decided to have the implementation and tests in the same file because it reduces complexity regarding file imports(for some reason I was having trouble importing files and spent a significant amount of time on that (1.5 hours+) so I decided to just have everything in one file)
- I decided to test the method by using an array with the expected data stored inside of it, so on the tests I just check if the arrays match
- Data for tests is stored in the data folder in Main/tests
- An assumption that I made was that the data would remain in the same format for the entire time(no special characters, each patient has a first and last name)
- I also wanted to mention that I am new to using pytest(and testing in general), so the way I tested the code might not be best practice
